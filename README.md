A sample app for Firefox OS that exports contacts to a vCard file on SD.

# WebAPI
[Contacts API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAPI/Contacts) is used to load all contacts from the address book.

[Device Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAPI/Device_Storage) is used to save a vCard file to the SD Card.

# Other Frameworks

This application uses [jQuery Mobile](http://www.jquerymobile.com/) to build its interface.

A minimal mozContact to vCard library is included in vCard.js
